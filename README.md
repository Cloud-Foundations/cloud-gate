cloud-gate is a Cloud Authentication Broker. It uses an IDentity Provider (IDP)
such as [keymaster](https://github.com/Cloud-Foundations/keymaster) to authenticate users
and then grants WebUI and API access to accounts and roles in a Cloud
environment.

## Build

We use [getlantern/systray] (https://github.com/getlantern/systray) for the systray gui.
